The <strong>Trabant</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key">/tr?'b??nt/</a> is a car that was produced by former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">East German</a> auto maker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VEB_Sachsenring_Automobilwerke_Zwickau">VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwickau">Zwickau</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony">Saxony</a>. It was the most common vehicle in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany">East Germany</a>, and was also exported to countries both inside and outside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_bloc">communist bloc.</a> The main selling points were that it had room for four adults and luggage in a compact, light and durable shell; it was fast (when introduced); and it was durable.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>With its poor performance, outdated and inefficient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stroke_engine">two-stroke engine</a> (which returned poor fuel economy for the car's size and produced smoky exhaust), and production shortages, the Trabant is often cited as an example of the disadvantages of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy">centralized planning;</a> on the other hand, it is also regarded with derisive affection as a symbol of the failed former East Germany and of the fall of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">communism</a> (in former West Germany, as many East Germans streamed into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin">West Berlin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany">West Germany</a> in their Trabants after the opening of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall">Berlin Wall</a> in 1989). It was in production without any significant changes for nearly 30 years, with 3,096,099 Trabants produced in total.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant#cite_note-3">[3]</a> In 2008, Time magazine rated the Trabant as one of the 50 worst cars ever made.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant#cite_note-4">[4]</a> In the West, much has been written about the Trabant, mostly negative: to comedic effect, emphasis was placed on the shortcomings of the Trabant, rather than its good points, such as that it was simple to operate and easily repaired. However, many of the former owners of the Trabant still emphasize advantages such as high capacity—the Trabant being able to carry over 1000 kg of cargo, and in some cases it has become trendy for collectors to import older models to the US due to their low cost and easier import restrictions on antique vehicles.</p>

<p>The name, meaning "satellite" or "companion" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">German</a>, was inspired by Soviet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_program">Sputnik</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant#cite_note-5">[5]</a> The cars are often referred to as the Trabbi or Trabi, pronounced /'tr??bi/ trah-bee in English.</p>
<p>Due to the long waiting period between ordering a Trabant and actually taking delivery (in some cases years passed as scarce materials were obtained), people who finally received one treated the car gently and were meticulous in maintaining and repairing it. The lifespan of an average Trabant was 28 years.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant#cite_note-autogenerated1-6">[6]</a> Used Trabants would often fetch a higher price than new ones, as the former were available immediately, while the latter required the infamous long wait.</p>

<p>There were four principal variants of the Trabant:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the P50, also known as the Trabant 500, produced 1957–1962</li>
    <li>the Trabant 600, produced 1962–1964</li>
    <li>the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant_601">Trabant 601</a>, produced 1963–1991</li>
    <li>the Trabant 1.1, produced 1990–1991 with a 1,043 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_centimetre">cc</a> (63.6 cu in) VW engine (making the "1.1" a slight misnomer)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The engine for the 500, 600, and original 601 was a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stroke_engine">two-stroke</a> engine with two cylinders, giving the vehicle modest performance. However, the combination of the vehicle's very light curb weight (~600 kg / 1100 pounds) with the engine's ability to go quickly to high revs made its acceleration between 30–50 km/h quite formidable. Given also the very fast gear shifts possible with the gear stick on the left side under the steering wheel, in a skilled driver's hands, the Trabant could easily outperform modern cars in short sprints between traffic lights.</p>
<p>At the end of production in 1989, the Trabant delivered 19 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt">kW</a> (26<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower"> horsepowers</a>) from a 600 cc (37 cu in) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_displacement">displacement</a>. The car took 21 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph); the top speed was 112 km/h (70 mph), with an official maximum speed attained of 100 km/h. Amongst various techniques often implemented in kitchen conditions to boost the car performance were: lowering cylinder heads, polishing the engine's intake manifolds and modifying carburetors. It was not uncommon to reach speeds of 130 km/h (the dial going beyond the blue signal light on a tachometer) on flat terrain with an empty car.</p>

<p>There were two main problems with the engine: the smoky exhaust and the pollution it produced – nine times the hydrocarbons and five times the carbon monoxide emissions of the average European car of 2007. The fuel consumption was 7 l/100 km (40 mpg-imp; 34 mpg-US).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant#cite_note-7">[7]</a> Since the engine did not have an oil injection system, two-stroke oil had to be added to the 24-litre (6.3 U.S. gal; 5.3 imp gal) fuel tank<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant#cite_note-8">[8]</a> every time the car was filled up, at a 50:1 or 33:1 ratio of fuel to oil. Gas stations of the time, in countries where two-stroke engines were common, served premixed gas-oil mixture from the pump. Today, owners normally carry a container of two-stroke oil in the car for this purpose. Because the car lacked a fuel pump, the fuel tank was placed above the motor in the engine compartment so that fuel could be fed to the carburetor by gravity; a trade-off of this design was an increased fire risk in front-end accidents. Earlier models had no fuel gauge; a dipstick was inserted into the tank to determine how much fuel remained.</p>

<p>The Trabant was a steel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trabant_2.JPG">monocoque</a> design with roof, boot/trunk lid, bonnet/hood, bumpers/fenders, and doors in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duroplast">Duroplast</a>. Duroplast was a hard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic">plastic</a> (similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakelite">Bakelite</a>) made of recycled materials: cotton waste from the Soviet Union and phenol resins from the East German dye industry, making the Trabant the first car with a body made of recycled material.[6] The results of some crash tests showed it performed better than some contemporary Western <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback">hatchbacks</a>.[9][10][11] The Trabant was the second car to use Duroplast, after the "pre-Trabant" P70 (Zwickau) model (1954–1959).
Production of the Trabant reached 3.7 million vehicles on 30 April 1991.[12]</p>
